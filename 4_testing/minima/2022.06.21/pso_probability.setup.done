========== Algorithm "pso_probability" ==========
Setup result of algorithm "pso_probability" (done) are At final iteration 18: final optimizer is best position = {x1=3.1275, x2=3.1327}, best value = -0.9996



========== Algorithm "pso_probability" ==========
Setup result of algorithm "pso_probability" on training dataset 'hdp_sample' with assigned ID '1' (done) are Learned models: Function "-cos(x1)*cos(x2)*exp(-((x1-PI)^2)-((x2-PI)^2))" gets optimal at best position = {x1=3.1275, x2=3.1327}, best value = -0.9996
